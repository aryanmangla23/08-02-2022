At 10, worked on japanese, but wanted to freshen up by showering and going to central park santa clara library, the closest one near me. But it opens at randoms time. I think they shortened the timings, because no students go to that library, since covid ended. Probably just like slow negligence and decline of it. So it opens 3-7 today so I just decided to go run, shower, then work at home cuz 3-7 is too short and late for library. 

Today's vibe: [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Di20x6vVVU).

Worked on Japanese for 3 more hours

K 5:30, now I'm sad [:<](https://open.spotify.com/track/3jXl94Bd3ONk4yTVgYPR30?si=f1a897ec16c6441b). Not sad cuz of memories, just the song just makes me sad.
