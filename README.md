At 10, worked on japanese, but wanted to freshen up by showering and going to central park santa clara library, the closest one near me. But it opens at randoms time. I think they shortened the timings, because no students go to that library, since covid ended. Probably just like slow negligence and decline of it. So it opens 3-7 today so I just decided to go run, shower, then work at home cuz 3-7 is too short and late for library.
